# Go SDK deletion preflight

See [Agent deletion protection](registry.md#agent-deletion-protection).

`Client.PreflightDelete(ctx, core.DeleteRequest{Kind: core.KindAgent, Ref: "uid:..."})`
checks the Registry cascade without runtime access or writes, including process
Agents and Project graphs. Call it before stopping a provider for deletion.
Protected Agents produce `*projmux.Refusal` with `CodeAgentProtected`
(`agent-protected`), the same token used by CLI delete, unregister and prune.
`Delete` and `UnregisterProject` also check previews and locked execution.
Preflight is a snapshot check, not authorization for a later runtime effect;
frontends must still use the deletion executor's locked admission when executing.
Remove `projmux.io/protected` with `Label` or the CLI before retrying.
